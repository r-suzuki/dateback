Title: Collect R Packages on a Specified Date with Dependencies
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Ryota Suzuki <suzuki@ef-prime.com>
Maintainer: Ryota Suzuki <suzuki@ef-prime.com>
Description: Works like a virtual CRAN snapshot for source packages.
    It automatically downloads `tar.gz` files with dependencies,
    all of which were available on a specific day.
    The output directory can be used as a local package repository.
    This package aims to (partially) substitute the "CRAN Time Machine"
    (or "MRAN Time Machine") and its related `checkpoint` package,
    which no longer work because of the retirement in July 2023
    (<https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2023/01/mran-time-machine-retired.html>).
