\description{
Collect and install source packages on a specified date with dependencies.

\code{install()} automatically downloads and installs \code{tar.gz} files
with dependencies, all of which were available on a specific day.

Downloaded contents are saved in \code{outdir} (if set) which can be
used as a local repository for \code{\link[utils]{install.packages}()}.

Use \code{collect()} to create a local repository without installation.
See the example for details.
}
\arguments{
  \item{pkgs}{character vector of the names of packages.}
  \item{date}{character specifying a date in \code{YYYY-MM-DD} format.
    It tries to find source packages which were available on this date.}
  \item{outdir}{character specifying the output directory path.
    In \code{install()} it can be \code{NULL} to use a temporary directory.
    It will contain downloaded source packages, and can be used as
    a local package repository. See the example for details.}
  \item{repos}{CRAN mirror URL such as \code{https://cloud.r-project.org}.}
  \item{lib}{character vector of the library directories used in
    \code{\link[utils]{install.packages}()}.}
  \item{dependencies}{character vector of the dependency level
    for additional downloads. It can include
    \code{c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo", "Suggests")}.}
  \item{skip_installed}{logical. If \code{TRUE} it does not collect files for
    packages already installed.}
  \item{skip_recommended}{logical. If \code{TRUE} it does not collet files for
    "recommended" packages.}
  \item{overwrite}{logical. If \code{TRUE} it overwrites existing files in
    \code{outdir}.}
  \item{\dots}{Arguments to be passed to \code{\link[utils]{install.packages}()}}.
